# PolyglotBot

> Why prompt one model when you can prompt many?

![Polyglot icon](polyglot.png)

Prompt once and receive answers from GPT, Claude, Llama, Mistral and relevant popular bots all at once.
Compare responses, evaluate models, hear opinions from multiple sources, donâ€™t just rely on one.
The system uses 4 models by default and triggers custom models for specific queries, when you ask culinary, psychology, or fitness-related questions.

## Usage

To communicate with bot, please navigate to [poe.com and find the PolyglotBotAI](https://poe.com/PolyglotBotAI).
Alternatively, you can re-create the setup using Modal to serve the stateless backend:

```sh
modal serve main.py
modal deploy main.py # if you are done building and want to ship ;)
```

In case you update the list of available modal, make sure to manually trigger the update on the Quora or Poe side:

```sh
curl -X POST https://api.poe.com/bot/fetch_settings/PolyglotBotAI/$POE_ACCESS_TOKEN
```

The system can use our custom RAG with Wikipedia and Arxiv papers, if provided the backend address:

```sh
curl -L "${WEB_SEARCH_BACKEND}/search?query=Text&top_k=5"
```

## Setup

```sh
conda create -n polyglotbot python=3.10
conda activate polyglotbot
```
